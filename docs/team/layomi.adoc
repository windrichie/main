== PROJECT: Efficient Learning Scheduler

---

== Overview

This is a desktop Efficient Learning Scheduler application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is a Java application targeting NUS School of Computing students who are interested to learn how to learn. Our efficient learning scheduler implements ALSET’s proven learning strategy such as spacing. We believe that with our application at your expense, you will be able to develop a good and efficient learning habit that will help you achieve your academic or career goals.
== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add an activity to a Person's timetable*
** What it does: adds an activity to a Person's timeTable.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user needs to be able to add an activity to the timeTable.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires adding many classes in all 4 components of the application - Logic, Model, UI and Storage, thus it requires me to have a good understanding of the whole application.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a getStringTimeTable method that changes the timeTable to a 2D array of Strings.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
