== PROJECT: Efficient Learning Scheduler

---

== Overview

Efficient Learning Scheduler is a desktop application targeting NUS School of Computing (SoC) students who wish to improve their learning schedule. It is especially useful for students who tend to do last-minute studying for exams and are not able to manage their busy schedules to include incremental learning throughout a semester.
Users interact with the application using a CLI and it has a GUI which is created using JavaFX. It is written in Java. Our scheduler implements Insitute for Application of Learning Science and Educational Technology (ALSET)'s learning strategy such as spacing.
Users can also keep track of the events in NUS such as recruitment talks or career festival which might interest of the users.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the event calendar component to the application, including `AddEvent`, `ListEvent`, and `CheckAvailEvent` [Coming in v2.0] Command.*
** What it does: allows users to keep track of the interesting events happening in NUS and check whether they are available to attend the event.
*** When a user is interested in an event in NUS, he/she can add the event with the relevant details such as title, time, date and venue to the application by the `addevent` command.
*** Next, he/she can use the `checkavailevent` [Coming in v2.0] command to check whether there is anything that clashes with the event.
*** Alternatively, if he/she wants to look at a list of interesting events (previously stored events), the `listevent` command will list the events at the left pane of the GUI.
** Justification: This feature improves the product because an NUS SoC student should keep up to date to the events happening in NUS which may be beneficial to him/her in the future.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires adding many classes in all 4 components of the application - Logic, Model, UI and Storage, thus it requires me to have a good understanding of the whole application.
** Credits: Regex expression for date including leap years validation from online library.

* *Minor enhancement*: included checking for the user inputs for certain attributes of `AddEvent` command, such as time (has to contain start time and end time), date and title.
